# Data Analysis Using Python

This repository has a list of projects which is being implemented using Python. The data sets used for these projects are publicily available.
The code is being implemented using Python Notebooks and the description of each step is defined within Notebooks.

[Data Analysis Using Python](https://github.com/aashisharora13/Data-Analysis-Using-Python/blob/main/Hands-on%20Data%20Analysis%20with%20Python.ipynb) - This Notebook comprises of step by step process of conducting data analysis using python. The main focus is on using python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and scikit_learn. This notebook also comprises basic implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes classifier and k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict the outcomes.
